Hello world!

This will mark the start of my 10000 hours web3 challenge, I will spend these hours learning and implementing skills that will aid me in web3.

I intend to split the hours amongst coding/developing and data analytics, as i am unable to decide on which to focus on for now.

Let's have some fun!
